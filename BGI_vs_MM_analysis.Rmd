## Background

In my placement project, the results of DESeq2 analysis on BGI genomics' results indicated that many small RNAs were diferentially expressed, meeting significance thresholds of p-adj \< 0.05.

During my Honours, I ran DESeq2 on the miRMaster results, which indicated that none were significantly deferentially expressed. This work was completed in the file miRMaster_DE_analyses.Rmd.

In that document, DESeq2 analyses were performed on individual small RNA classes, and then on all small RNA types at once. In both cases, no small RNAs met the significance threshold.

The top 6 small RNAs closest to being significantly differentially expressed (closest to possessing padj \< 0.05) in the BGI and miRMaster datasets were different for each dataset.

This indicated that the BGI and miRMaster pipelines operate differently.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to examine and compare the structures of the dataset after analysis with miRMaster's pipeline and BGI genomics' own pipeline.

A volcano plot was constructed to identify whether the results from my placement project could be replicated. The results were indeed the same, as shown in the volcano plot in this document (there are 3 versions of the same plot, the parameters are identical but the labelling is different because there are challenges with interpreting the plot when there are too many labels on it).

To further explore the differences between the miRMaster and BGI results, 5 miRNAs which passed basic filtering (at least 5 counts across at least 3 samples, no NA values, passed all of DESeq2's built in filtering) in both datasets were identified for further examination. Both datasets were TMM-normalised, then the normalised counts of mmu-miR-145a-5p in each dataset were be compared using a bar plot.

## Note

It is highly suspected that the novel piRNAs labelled in the volcano plot are isomiRs / miRNA variants. As discussed in my placement project, piRNAs have a unique structure which can occasionally cause them to be labelled incorrectly.

(Figure caption) The counts of mmu-miR-145a-5p reported by miRMaster (orange) and BGI genomics (blue) were normalised using TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values) normalisation so that observations would not be skewed by composition bias or variations in sequencing depth. It was observed that there was a discrepancy between the counts of mmu-miR-145a-5p reported by miRMaster (orange) and by BGI genomics (blue).

## PCA plot with DESeq2-analysed sncRNA data
Reproducing results from placement. Counts were subjected to basic filtering (removed rows from raw data without at least 5 counts across 3 samples) and then DESeq2 analysis. 

The top 500 most DE sncRNAs are included in this PCA. The ntop = 500 argument in the plotPCA() function is specifying the number of top genes to include in the PCA plot based on their variance. In this case, it is selecting the top 500 genes with the highest variance across the samples to be used for the PCA.

# Need PCA on TMM normalised MM data
```
(Figure caption) PCA on TMM-normalised BGI sncRNA data did not indicate that treatment group was a primary source of variance in the dataset. This constrasted the results obtained from the PCA performed on the top 500 most differentially expressed sncRNAs.

It makes sense that these results are different to the placement results because these results have not been through DE analysis. 

This could suggest that a majority of the sncRNAome did not react to treatment in a significant way, however, a small subset of it is. It might be ideal to take the 500 most DE sncRNAs listed in the DESeq2 PCA results, and use their TMM-normalised counts for mixomics later, since a large portion of the sncRNAome seems quiet.

## Top 500 listed sncRNAs from DE analysis
The top 500 most DE sncRNAs from the initial PCA (the one that is a replicate of the results gathered in placement, produced in 2023 at https://github.com/ChishanB/expression_profile_of_mouse_seminal_vesicle/blob/main/2_PCA_and_DeSeq.R) were noted. The results are stored in sncRNA_DeSeq_complete.csv and sncRNA_DeSeq_complete_FIXED (the latter is just missing an uneeded column). 
We will use the top 500 sncRNAs with the most variance to re-construct PCA plots for the BGI data and miRMaster data, and hopefully this time we will see clear distinction between treatment groups.

The data was prepared for the PCA plots below as follows (consitent with placement pipeline for plotting standardised data)
- Obtain the rows in TMM_BGI_sncRNAs (standardised data) that match top_genes (character string of the names of top ~500 most DE sncRNAs from the DESeq2 analysis)
- log2 the TMM standardised data
- Zscore 
- plot with autoplot function

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# top_genes is a character vector containing our most DE sncRNAs 
# TMM_BGI_sncRNAs is already ready from previous PCA

# Replace spaces with underscores in row names
rownames(TMM_BGI_sncRNAs) <- gsub(" ", "_", rownames(TMM_BGI_sncRNAs))

# I only want the rows in TMM_BGI_sncRNAs that match top_genes

# Filter dataframe by row names
filtered_TMM_BGI_sncRNAs <- TMM_BGI_sncRNAs[rownames(TMM_BGI_sncRNAs) %in% top_genes, ]

# Same for MM data
#filtered_TMM_MM_sncRNAs <- TMM_MM_sncRNAs[rownames(TMM_MM_sncRNAs) %in% top_genes, ]

####### ARRRGHHHH MM uses different naming convention so I've gotta get around that

  ggtitle("sncRNA response to acrylamide insult (BGI, top 500 most DE, TMM, z-scored)")  # Add title

(Figure caption) The top 500 most DE sncRNAs were identified from the raw dataset. PCA analysis on TMM-standardised sncRNA counts (BGI's counts) implied that 19.48% of variation is associated with treatment, as shown by the distinct separation between treatment groups on the y-axis. 

(Discussion) The PCA plot indicates that treatment is only the second largest factor causing variance in the dataset (n = 482). My understanding is that the number 1 cause is the fact that sncRNA data has extremely high variance by nature as part of normal biological function, hence, these results saying that treatment is the second largest factor are very promising. 



## Discussion for bar plots

The differences in the counts for mmu-miR-145a-5p between BGI and MM became less prominent post-standardisation. Prominent differences remain which indicate inherent differences between the tools' workflows.

Causes for BGI having more counts may include:

-   BGI reported a lot of novel miRNAs which may or may have been known miRNAs that weren't correctly identified.

-   There could be PCR amplification bias.

<!-- -->

-   It's possible MM uses a more stringent aligment method than BGI. Could do some research on whether either tool allows partial matches or includes multi mapped reads which can increase counts.

-   MM might use a more curated database that excludes partial matches, whereas BGI might be using databases with duplicate/overlapping entries for the same miRNA.

-   MM might be de-duplicating reads, whereas BGI might not.

-   The tools may be optimised differently and have different biases.
